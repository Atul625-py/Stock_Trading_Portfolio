# Stock_Trading_Portfolio

Hi Everyone. This is me Atul Kumar Pandey
and my teammate Chukka Chamantej
designing a website to buy and sell stocks 
as our ITW project of IIT - BHU.

The backend has been developed using django.
I have also used ml to develop a recommendation
system. I aim to convert this website into 
an algo trading platform later on.

To use this do the following.

1. Make a clone of my repo on your pc.
Use => git clone https://github.com/Atul625-py/Stock_Trading_Portfolio.git

2. Run this server with following command.

python manage.py runserver

I will update this as i develop the backend.
