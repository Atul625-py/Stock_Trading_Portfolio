# Stock Trading Portfolio

## Project Overview

Welcome to the **Stock Trading Portfolio** project! This website allows users to buy and sell stocks and is being developed as part of the ITW project at **IIT (BHU)** by **Atul Kumar Pandey** and **Chukka Chamantej**.  
The backend is powered by **Django**, and the project includes a machine learning-based recommendation system to enhance the user experience.  
Our long-term goal is to evolve this platform into a full-fledged algorithmic trading solution.

## Features
- **User-friendly interface** for stock trading.
- **Machine Learning-based recommendation system** to assist users in making informed trading decisions.
- **Future Goals**: Convert the platform into an algorithmic trading system.
